Each experiment's results are in a separate folder.

You can find the command used to run the experiment in command.sh in the
experiment folder, for example, final-hinge-1/command.sh.

The files test_knn_N_stats give query results (accuracy, recall@K), and
test_knn_N_query give results for a queried image -- the first image is the
query image, and the remaining results are the nearest neighbors. Each line
starts with the queried image, followed by N+1 image paths -- the queried
image, and unique N other nearest neighbors.

The file test_stats gives F1 score, NMI and other metrics for clustering,
evaluated on test split.
